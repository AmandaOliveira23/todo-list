# To-do List

This *to-do list* was created to help people keep their lives organized. <br> Among its features, daily commitments can be added to the list and marked as checked once completed. There is a filter with three options to choose from: all tasks, only checked tasks, and tasks that still need to be completed. Additionally, it is possible to search for tasks, edit them, and delete them. 
<br>Furthermore, all data is saved in local storage, allowing the page to be refreshed without losing any tasks.
